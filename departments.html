                  The work of God at Buzuruga SDA church is divided into several
                  departments and units to meet the various needs of God's
                  people in our areas. The main goal of all these departments is
                  to effectively fulfill the mission of the Adventists by
                  helping everyone understand the Bible and find freedom,
                  healing, and hope in Jesus Christ.

                    </li>
                    The Church elder is a steadfast spiritual leader, a person
                    with a good reputation for Christian character and conduct
                    both within the church and in the community. They serve in
                    the local church as an assistant to the pastor, who is
                    appointed by the conference to serve the specific church.
                    The elder supports the pastor in leading the church towards
                    a deeper and more complete Christian faith through teaching,
                    being an example, and overseeing programs that will help the
                    church grow and fulfill its mission. When someone is chosen
                    to be an elder of the church, the primary consideration is
                    not their ability to preach or their position in the
                    community, but rather their testimony of a holy life and
                    their leadership abilities. The Elder of the Church is a
                    leader.

                    </li>
                    The Church Clerk is a vital part of the church's operations.
                    Their duties include recording important church matters such
                    as meeting minutes, official church letters, and maintaining
                    various church records. One of the most important aspects
                    within the church is the fellowship among its members, and
                    one of the Church Clerk's tasks is to manage the church's
                    membership records. One of the first responsibilities upon
                    being appointed as Church Clerk is to ensure you have the
                    church manual, preferably the latest edition. As the Clerk,
                    you will need to understand how the church board operates
                    because much of your work will involve close collaboration
                    with the church board. The Clerk should carefully study and
                    fully understand the sections of the Church Manual that
                    cover membership and the procedures for council meetings.

                      <h4 class="title"><strong>Church Treasurer</strong></h4>
                    </li>
                    Due to the important responsibilities of the treasurer, it
                    is advisable to choose someone who can be re-elected to
                    ensure continuity in the safekeeping and reporting of
                    financial matters. Larger churches may appoint assistant
                    treasurers according to their needs. The treasurer can
                    greatly encourage faithfulness in returning tithes and
                    foster a spirit of giving among the members. Guidance given
                    in the spirit of the Lord will help members faithfully
                    return their tithes and offerings to the Lord, even during
                    financially challenging times.

                      <h4 class="title"><strong>Stewardship</strong></h4>
                    </li>
                    The essence of the stewardship department's work is to
                    encourage believers to make good use of what God has given
                    them, including their abilities, talents, time, bodies, and
                    even possessions. The local church, along with each
                    individual member, is generally responsible for how they
                    manage what they have been given, overseeing stewardship
                    education and guiding people to understand stewardship in
                    all aspects of human life. When we look at stewardship in
                    its entirety, it is the foundation of mission and the goal
                    of true discipleship. Many people often assume this
                    department is solely focused on collecting money, but the
                    truth is that the Stewardship Department exists to help
                    believers become Christ’s disciples in managing wealth,
                    talents, and all the blessings that God has bestowed upon
                    humanity. Jesus spent much of His time speaking about
                    possessions or wealth that people have. One-third of the
                    parables He gave involved either wealth, money, or what a
                    person possesses. This is because He knew that His listeners
                    would not fully understand the principles of God's kingdom
                    until they first understood their stewardship relationship
                    with their God. In His Sermon on the Mount, He told the
                    crowds,
                    <em
                      >“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be
                      also.”</em
                    >
                    <strong>(Matthew 6:21)</strong>. The Stewardship Department
                    is very important for the spiritual growth of anyone who is
                    serious about strengthening their relationship with God.

                    </li>
                    When someone is chosen to be a deacon, it signifies that the
                    church trusts that person because the Scriptures provide
                    important guidelines regarding the character or conduct of
                    the individual. If you are called to be a deacon, thank God,
                    for the Bible promises that those who serve well as deacons
                    will receive a good standing and great confidence in their
                    faith in Christ Jesus.
                    <strong>1 Timothy 3:13</strong> states,
                    <em
                      >"For those who have served well as deacons obtain for
                      themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith

                    broader sense, is similar to the mission for all within the
                    church—namely, to uplift Christ in the church and throughout
                    the world.

                    Dorcas is not a department but a group. This group operates
                    under the Personal Ministries Department. Dorcas focuses on
                    outreach services, evangelism, and assistance for those in
                    need with the aim of winning souls. The Dorcas group plays a
                    crucial role in the church's mission activities; it is
                    dedicated to identifying and addressing specific needs that
                    impact individuals and the community at large, with the goal
                    of opening doors for relationships and ultimately creating
                    opportunities to preach the gospel. This group gathers and
                    organizes clothing, food, and other necessities for the
                    poor, needy, and distressed. The Dorcas group works in
                    cooperation with male and female deacons and the AMO
                    (Adventist Missionary Outreach).

                    AMO AMO stands for

                    translated into Swahili as "Chama cha Wanaume Waadventista."
                    Like Dorcas, AMO is not a department but a group operating
                    under the Personal Ministries Department. It is an
                    undeniable fact that for the church to grow rapidly and
                    become strong, it is crucial to reach out to men. By
                    reaching men, you effectively reach their families to a
                    large extent. Recent research has shown that men can
                    significantly impact their family's church attendance more
                    than women and children can affect it. When a father attends
                    church, the whole family usually attends as well. The AMO
                    group aims to help men understand how to address their roles
                    as Christian husbands and fathers, and to encourage their
                    commitment and dedication to God's work. This group works in
                    cooperation with male and female deacons as well as Dorcas.

                    </li>
                    Statistics from July 2015 indicated that the global
                    population had already reached 7.3 billion. According to
                    Statista, by January 2018, the number of internet users (one
                    of the most modern tools in the communication industry) had
                    reached 3.17 billion, nearly half of the world's population.
                    This shows that a large number of people were already
                    heavily engaged in receiving or sending information through
                    modern communication methods. This means that over forty
                    percent (40%) of the world's population were already using
                    the internet. In 1995, the number of internet users was less
                    than one percent (1%). The number of internet users
                    increased tenfold from 1999 to 2013. The number reached one
                    billion in 2005, two billion by 2010, and three billion by
                    2014. It is estimated that by 2020, more than half of the
                    world's population will be internet users. This implies that
                    as a church, we need to consider new ways to enhance our
                    mission or evangelistic activities, and to communicate with
                    people (with the aim of reaching them) through methods that
                    enable us to reach a larger audience more quickly and
                    efficiently. For example, according to Statista, by 2017,
                    approximately 2.46 billion people were using social media to
                    receive and share information worldwide. This is estimated
                    to be more than one-third of the world’s population.
                    Therefore, to reach people effectively according to current
                    statistics, we should direct one-third of our evangelistic
                    efforts towards using social media, as this is where many
                    people are found. In the present era, the church must
                    actively engage in mission activities using modern methods
                    to reach people with the message of hope about what is
                    coming to the world soon, namely the return of our Lord
                    Jesus Christ. This is why the Communication Department
                    encourages the use of a robust communication strategy and
                    all modern communication techniques, sustainable technology,
                    and media to spread the gospel

                    The church believes that the responsibility of making Christ

                    promoting high standards of physical, mental, and spiritual
                    health. In addition to serving those who are ill, this
                    responsibility extends to disease prevention through
                    appropriate health education and leadership in encouraging
                    good health without the use of tobacco, alcohol, other
                    drugs, and unclean foods. When possible, members will be
                    primarily encouraged to avoid eating meat.

                    The purpose of family services is to strengthen marriages
                    and families. The family was established by God’s creation,
                    with marriage as its core. As the primary place where values
                    are taught and the ability to relate to God and others is
                    developed, the well-being of the family is crucial for the
                    church’s mission to make disciples.

                    </li>
                    Worshiping God according to one's conscience and
                    participating in the love of Christ is a valued freedom that
                    is not enjoyed everywhere in the world. God's governance is
                    built on the freedom to choose. God chose to create humans
                    with the ability to choose as well. “See, I have set before
                    you today life and good, death and evil... blessings and
                    curses; therefore choose life, that both you and your
                    descendants may live” (Deuteronomy 30:15, 19). Religious
                    freedom is like a fragile flower; it must receive the
                    strongest possible protection and the most careful nurture
                    available. In this context, freedom of conscience can either
                    thrive or be suppressed and weakened. Revelation 13
                    describes the political authority that will emerge in the
                    last days and cause people to “worship” another religious
                    authority with political power. Religion and politics are
                    depicted in Revelation 17 as an apostate church supported by
                    the state. Then, the force of persecution from this
                    church-state union is symbolized by a woman who is drunk
                    with the blood of the saints. What should we do about the
                    threats and signs of the erosion of religious freedom? Ellen
                    White said, “It is our duty to do all we can to prevent the
                    impending danger. We should strive to remove prejudice by
                    presenting ourselves in a proper light before people. We
                    should bring before them the real issues involved, and thus
                    intervene to prevent resistance that could be more harmful
                    to measures protecting freedom of conscience”

                    The Children’s Services Department coordinates all

                    trains teachers to instruct various subjects within the
                    church; supports and assists child leaders; and advocates
                    for the welfare of children. The Children’s Services
                    Coordinator works with the pastor and the board to establish
                    a Children's Services Committee to serve the children. This
                    committee will consist of individuals who are passionate and
                    experienced in serving children. Typical members include
                    leaders of the Sabbath School divisions, the Vacation Bible
                    School leader, Adventist Young People leaders, and two or
                    three others with a passion for working with children. If
                    the church has a Children’s Services Department, Vacation
                    Bible Schools, children’s Sabbath School branches,
                    neighborhood Bible clubs, and story hours will fall under

                    It is crucial that those passionate about gospel listening
                    due to the church's mission efforts be attended to promptly.
                    Church members often build relationships with non-members
                    through evangelistic meetings, various seminars, attending
                    services with guests, and other events that offer
                    opportunities to meet and build connections. Similarly,
                    there are individuals within the church who, through their
                    appeal and friendship with those around the church, develop
                    relationships that lead others to be attracted to and
                    appreciate the church or its services. In all of this, it is
                    the responsibility of the listening leader to create an
                    environment that maintains relationships and encourages
                    individuals to join the church, while also establishing ways
                    to follow up with those who are interested in the church's
                    services.

                    faith-based broadcasting for over 90 years. Founded in 1929
                    by H.M.S. Richards Sr., the ministry focuses on providing
                    Christ-centered media that highlights God’s love, announces
                    His imminent return, offers hope to the brokenhearted, and
                    provides guidance for daily living. Supporting evangelism
                    for the local church is the core of the Voice of Prophecy's
                    mission. Hundreds of churches across North America use Voice
                    of Prophecy media and evangelistic resources to reach their
                    communities for Christ in relevant and effective ways. Its
                    long-established Bible study materials are available in over
                    70 languages and in various user-friendly formats, both
                    printed and digital. Additionally, its humanitarian projects

                    inspire worship and thanksgiving to God." — PP 594. "Jesus
                    communicated with heaven through songs." — DA 73. Music is
                    one of the highest forms of art. Good music not only brings
                    us joy but also elevates our minds and enhances our finest
                    qualities. Frequently, God has used spiritual songs to touch
                    the hearts of sinners and lead them to repentance. On the
                    other hand, music can also corrupt morals and disrupt our
                    relationship with God. We must be very careful in choosing
                    music for our homes, social gatherings, schools, and
                    churches. Any music, whether jazz, rock, or any related
                    mixed genres, or lyrics expressing trivial or unimportant

                    </li>
                    Youth are not only the Church of tomorrow but also the
                    Church of today. The significance of youth continues to be
                    evident daily, not just in the Church but also in the
                    community. The Adventist Church is also a church of this
                    generation's youth. Youth are powerful individuals with
                    great potential for thought and action in their lives; hence
                    the Scriptures say:
                    <em
                      >"I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and
                      the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the
                      wicked one."</em
                    >
                    <strong>—1 John 2:1</strong>4 Regarding youth, the prophet
                    says: "For the work to advance in all its areas, God needs
                    the strength, zeal, and courage of youth. He has chosen
                    young people to help advance His work. Wise planning and
                    bold action require fresh, unyielding strength. Young men
                    and women are invited to offer their youthful energy to God,
                    so that using their strength, thoughtful minds, and courage,
                    they may bring glory to God and salvation to their fellow
                    humans." <strong>—Gospel Workers, p. 67</strong>
                    <br />
                    <br /><strong>The Church is Also for Youth</strong> <br />

                    Historically, the Seventh-day Adventist Church did not have
                    a specific youth department; youth were involved in church
                    activities just like any other members. However, it's
                    important to remember that the revival movement of the 1840s
                    was largely driven by young people. This movement was led by
                    individuals like James White, who began preaching at age 21,
                    Ellen White, who received her first vision at age 17, and
                    John Loughborough, who started preaching at age 17. These
                    young people did not need someone to minister to them; they
                    were the ministers themselves, engaging passionately with
                    the truths they discovered in the Word of God.
                    <br />
                    <br /><strong>Origins of the Youth Department</strong>
                    <br />

                    The truth is that the Youth Department was established by
                    two young individuals who saw the need for it and brought it
                    to prayer. One young man, Luther Warren, was 14 years old at
                    the time, and the other, Harry Fenner, was 17. In 1879, they
                    knelt under a tree in their hometown of Hazelton, Michigan,
                    praying for guidance on how to reach other young people and
                    bring them to Jesus. Guided by their prayers, these two
                    young people established the first youth missionary band of
                    the church, consisting of nine boys. The Hazelton youth
                    band, which included prayer, hymn singing, officer
                    elections, reports on mission work, and contributions for
                    publishing, quickly grew into a youth community that
                    included both boys and girls. Their activities not only
                    involved religious services but also social events popular
                    at the time. Although parents and other adults in the church
                    were involved, leadership remained primarily in the hands of
                    the youth, especially Luther Warren, who continued his youth
                    ministry and evangelistic work within the Seventh-day
                    Adventist Church throughout his life. Later, a similar youth
                    missionary band was established in 1891 in Antigo,
                    Wisconsin, initiated by a young man named Meade MacGuire.
                    Within a few years of the establishment of the first youth
                    group, many other similar groups were formed in Seventh-day
                    Adventist churches across the United States. The first such
                    community outside North America was organized in Adelaide,
                    Australia, in 1892. In the General Conference session of
                    1901, the Seventh-day Adventist Church took its first steps
                    toward organizing its youth ministry. A proposal was passed
                    to arrange this youth community and create a committee to
                    oversee this process. Luther Warren, then a prominent young
                    figure in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was chosen as
                    the chairman of this committee. For the first time, the
                    Youth Department began to gain recognition in the Church. At
                    that time, the church had placed youth under the Sabbath
                    School Department, and Mrs. L. Flora Plummer (one of the
                    Sabbath School leaders) was assigned as the youth mentor. By
                    1905, the Adventist youth work was growing not only in the
                    United States but also in Australia, Germany, England,
                    Trinidad, Jamaica, Canada, and other countries. <br />
                    By 1907, the Youth Department continued to grow and reached
                    Africa, Tahiti, Singapore, Fiji, Portugal, Bermuda, Japan,
                    the Philippines, and Central America. In 1907, the Youth
                    Department was known as the Seventh-day Adventist Young
                    People's Department and was popularly referred to as MV,
                    which stands for Missionary Volunteers. In 1978, the name
                    changed to Adventist Youth (AY). In 2005, the department's
                    name was changed to Youth Ministries Department,
                    encompassing three levels of youth ministry: Explorers,
                    Pathfinders, and Adventurers. In 2015, the name changed
                    again to Adventist Youth Ministries.

                    </li>
                    Essentially, the Sabbath School, which is a core educational
                    program in the Church, has four main goals: studying the
                    Scriptures, fellowship, community service, and emphasizing
                    world mission. The Sabbath School and Personal Ministries
                    Department of the General Conference distributes Bible study
                    guidelines for all age levels, provides program structures
                    for Sabbath Schools in the context of various cultural
                    divisions worldwide, offers guidance and training systems
                    for Sabbath School teachers, and encourages the giving of
                    Sabbath School offerings for world mission. “Sabbath School
                    is a vital branch of missionary work, not only because it
                    provides knowledge of the Word of God to both youth and
                    adults, but because it instills in them a love for the
                    sacred truths of that Word and a desire to study it
                    themselves; above all, it teaches them to conduct their
                    lives in harmony with the sacred teachings of that truth.”
