                  Church is not about having four walls and a pulpit. It is
                  about living in harmony as the body of Christ. This means each
                  church member loves, respects and values the other members,
                  realizing that just as different organs make up the body, so
                  different members are needed to form the Church. Sure, we’ll
                  disagree sometimes, and from time to time, even the closest
                  families have some friction. That’s where Christian love and
                  patience come in. As Christians we have the privilege to model
                  for the world how God calls us to live in a caring,
                  compassionate community. Here’s to a happy family with Jesus
                  at the center!

                  <p>
                    Seventh-day Adventists are a global family of Christians who
                    hold the Bible as the ultimate authority. There are,
                    however, a few distinguishing characteristics that set them
                    apart from many other Christian denominations.

                    The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a family of Christian
                    believers who are united in mission, purpose and belief.
                    Regardless of which part of the world you’re in, you can
                    find Adventists seeking to follow biblical principles of
                    Christ-like living, communicating, discipling, teaching,
                    healing, and serving.

                <h2>The Church Led by Fulfilling Its Mission</h2>
                <p>
                  The word "Mission" means purpose. If your Church already has a
                  mission statement (in the context of a local church), you are
                  already one step ahead. If not, meet with church leaders and,
                  through prayer, develop a mission statement that encompasses
                  the three main aspects of the Great Commission for
                  evangelizing the world:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>

                      >Go (ministry of reaching out to the community and

                    >
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <p>
                    To fully fulfill the mission mandate, we must recognize that
                    the church exists to serve not only its members but also
                    those "still in the world." It may not be easy for the
                    Church to align its own missionary perspectives and efforts
                    with the biblical model of missionary activities. However,
                    the Church’s objectives and goals should always come from
                    the words of Christ, not from majority votes or other
                    sources. This holds true even in missionary matters. A
                    church that leads souls cannot be a church that resists
                    changes that return us to a proper implementation of the
                    Church’s mission. A church that leads souls cannot cling to
                    outdated methods that no longer align with the mission
                    mandate given by Jesus. When the church commits to following
                    the mission according to Jesus' mandate, it will be ready to
                    face challenges, initiate mission projects, and engage in
                    all forms of evangelism. Faithfulness in fulfilling the
                    mission mandate will drive people to contribute more of
                    their time and resources to evangelism efforts. Encourage
                    every member to dedicate themselves to the work of
                    evangelism. Use God First cards, created by the Stewardship
                    Department, and reinforce the fourth aspect, which
                    encourages people to make a covenant with God, asking the
                    Holy Spirit to open hearts and doors for each person to
                    witness to someone about the love of Jesus. We live in a
                    large community of people who have not yet received the
                    light that we have. It is the responsibility of the ministry
                    leader to create strategies for evangelism training for all
                    church members and to show them that the church exists to
                    share this light with those around us. Emphasize to the
                    members the great responsibility given to them by Christ.

                    There are many words used to refer to this broad topic. Here
                    are some examples:

                      <strong>Reaching others</strong><br />
                      Also a broad concept, focusing on evangelism activities
                      that each member can do. In scripture, evangelism means
                      sharing the good news of salvation with others. Common
                      perception: Many members view evangelism as public
                      preaching—an event where non-members are invited to hear
                      the teachings of the Church. Three Main Types of
                      Evangelism: Essentially, there are two main types of
                      evangelism—public evangelism and personal or small group
                      evangelism. In public evangelism, a preacher speaks to a
                      large audience, while in small group evangelism, the
                      evangelist speaks to one person or a small group of
                      listeners. Small groups have proven to be a more effective
                      way of spreading the gospel. All other forms of evangelism
                      build on these two types. The downside of relying solely
                      on public preaching: Unfortunately, if no decisive steps
                      are taken for discipleship, those baptized through public
                      preaching often do not remain in the church. Is it because
                      they find the teachings untrue? Not always. They leave
                      because they didn’t connect with friends who are the body
                      of Christ. In small groups, that friendship is already
                      established, making it harder to leave the church. God
                      wants us to work wisely...to pray, think, research, and
                      plan effective evangelism strategies before launching into
                      "evangelism implementation." Since we are responsible for
                      the work God has given us, we must establish evangelism
                      methods that will bear fruit in reaching the surrounding
                      community.

                    <li><h4>Biblical Approach to Successful Evangelism</h4></li>
                    “The only method that will bring true success in reaching
                    people is Christ’s method. The Savior mingled with people as
                    one who desired their good. He showed them compassion,
                    ministered to their needs, and won their trust. Then He said
                    to them, 'Follow me'”
                    <strong>(Ministry of Healing, p. 143)</strong> . Christ
                    listened and observed. He understood well the customs and
                    cultures of His time. To carry out evangelism, we must
                    consider two key things: we must know the Gospel and
                    understand the needs of the people around us. Christ spent
                    more time healing than preaching. Our gospel message cannot
                    be received unless it is accompanied by a genuine
                    demonstration of acts of compassion; it should be gospel in
                    action, not just gospel in words. Acts of compassion are the
                    bridge that connects us with unbelievers. We must cross
                    cultural and social boundaries to show that we care for and
                    love all people. When we follow this model of evangelism, we
                    will succeed in the work Christ has sent us to do, and we
                    will see the church spiritually revived and growing.

                      <h4>
                        Principles of Evangelistically Successful Churches
                      </h4>
                    </li>
                    What can we learn from the early Christian church about
                    evangelism and church growth? Can we regain the fellowship,
                    passion, and missionary zeal they had? The nature of the
                    church’s growth is clearly laid out in every part of the New
                    Testament that discusses this topic. Each time, the
                    evangelism process involved some form of relationship and
                    great attention to solving the social challenges of that
                    time. These factors allowed the gospel to spread quickly and
                    be received. The School of Church Ministries at Andrews
                    University has helped conduct many studies related to the
                    growth of the Adventist Church. They have gathered
                    sufficient evidence for us to know what will work and what
                    won’t. The results showed six key factors essential for
                    church growth:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      <h4>Factor One: Readiness</h4>
                    </li>
                    Wherever there is church growth, the leadership places a
                    strong emphasis on evangelism. The Church Council develops a
                    growth plan. Members are ready to see the church grow. They
                    view their church as a vessel for leading souls. Use
                    seminars, revival weeks, and 10-minute short seminars during
                    Sabbath School to cultivate readiness.

                    <li>
                      <h4>Factor Two: Small Groups</h4>
                    </li>
                    <em>Strengthening Friendships:</em> Small groups uniquely
                    provide opportunities to strengthen friendships and foster a
                    strong sense of fellowship. <br /><br />
                    <em>Involvement in Ministry:</em>
                    Through these groups, members are prepared to participate in
                    various evangelistic activities more easily. It also
                    simplifies the task of teaching practical skills and
                    nurturing their talents through active involvement.
                    <br /><br />
                    <em>Spiritual Maturity:</em>
                    Studying the Bible in small groups leads to personal study
                    time and allows members to contribute spiritually to others.
                    <br /><br />
                    <em>Strengthening New Members:</em>
                    When the church has enough small groups, new members get the
                    chance to adapt to the church, develop strong friendships,
                    and get involved in various church activities (which take
                    place in these groups).
                    <br /><br />
                    <em>Pastoral Care:</em>
                    The leaders of these groups serve as assistant pastors for
                    their group members. This is extremely important for church
                    growth, especially in our context, where many members fall
                    away after baptism due to a lack of visitation, prayer,
                    encouragement, and guidance.
                    <br /><br />
                    <em>Ongoing Evangelistic Activities: </em>
                    When every department in the church contributes to
                    evangelistic activities and involves all members in
                    execution, the church becomes stronger and more successful
                    in reaching its mission goals, which are often not achieved
                    by one person but by a group. In groups, members encourage
                    each other. This is why it's essential to collaborate with
                    the Sabbath School leadership to establish these small
                    groups, as they bring about positive results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      <h4>Factor Three: Involvement of Every Believer</h4>
                    </li>
                    Growing churches have a high percentage (at least 65%) of
                    members participating either in church leadership or in
                    every evangelistic activity organized by the church.
                    Reaching this level of involvement may be one of the biggest
                    challenges facing the Adventist Church in many areas.

                        Factor Four: Member Fellowship (Relationships Among
                        Members)
                      </h4>
                    </li>
                    Growing churches have a high level of care and forgiveness
                    among their members. People feel loved and needed. They
                    spend time showing care for one another. They seek out
                    inactive members and encourage them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      <h4>Factor Five: Engaging Guests</h4>
                    </li>
                    Growing churches intentionally involve guests and
                    influential people in the community in various church
                    activities. They make genuine efforts to integrate new
                    members into the church and eventually involve them in
                    ministry.

                    <li>
                      <h4>Factor Six: Youth Involvement</h4>
                    </li>
                    Typically, growing churches have a larger number of youth
                    compared to declining churches. Youth engagement and
                    evangelism are priorities for churches that want to grow.
                    Youth are a source of strength.

                  Seventh-day Adventists
                  accept the Bible as their
                  only creed and hold certain fundamental beliefs

                  the Holy Scriptures.
                Seventh-day Adventists accept the Bible as their only creed
and hold certain fundamental beliefs to be the teaching
of the Holy Scriptures. These beliefs, as set forth here,
constitute the church’s understanding and expression of the
teaching of Scripture. Revision of these statements may be
expected at a General Conference Session when the church is
led by the Holy Spirit to a fuller understanding of Bible truth
or finds better language in which to express the teachings of
God’s Holy Word. <br><br>

                  <p>The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testaments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration. The inspired
authors spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to humanity the
knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the supreme, authoritative, and the infallible revelation
of His will. They are the standard of character, the test of experience, the definitive revealer of doctrines, and the
trustworthy record of God’s acts in history. <p style="color: #1c265f;">(Ps. 119:105; Prov. 30:5, 6; Isa. 8:20; John 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:16,

                  <span><strong>The Trinity</strong></span>
                  <p>There is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, a unity of three coeternal Persons. God is immortal, all-powerful,
all-knowing, above all, and ever present. He is infinite and beyond human comprehension, yet known through His
self-revelation. God, who is love, is forever worthy of worship, adoration, and service by the whole creation. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Gen.
1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2.)</p></p>

                  <p>God the eternal Father is the Creator, Source, Sustainer, and Sovereign of all creation. He is just and holy, merciful
and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. The qualities and powers exhibited
in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also those of the Father. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> . (Gen. 1:1; Deut. 4:35; Ps. 110:1, 4; John 3:16; 14:9; 1 Cor.

                  <span><strong>The Son</strong></span>
                  <p>God the eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus Christ. Through Him all things were created, the character of God
is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became
also truly human, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and
experienced temptation as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. By His
miracles He manifested God’s power and was attested as God’s promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to heaven to minister in
the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the
restoration of all things. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Gen.
1:26; Deut. 6:4; Isa. 6:8; Matt. 28:19; John 3:16 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2.)</p></p>

                  <p>God the eternal Spirit was active with the Father and the Son in Creation, incarnation, and redemption. He is as
much a person as are the Father and the Son. He inspired the writers of Scripture. He filled Christ’s life with power.
He draws and convicts human beings; and those who respond He renews and transforms into the image of God.
Sent by the Father and the Son to be always with His children, He extends spiritual gifts to the church, empowers
it to bear witness to Christ, and in harmony with the Scriptures leads it into all truth. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> . (Gen. 1:1, 2; 2 Sam. 23:2; Ps.

                  <p>God has revealed in Scripture the authentic and historical account of His creative activity. He created the universe,
and in a recent six-day creation the Lord made “the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them” and
rested on the seventh day. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of the work He performed
and completed during six literal days that together with the Sabbath constituted the same unit of time that we call
a week today. The first man and woman were made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given
dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was “very
good,” declaring the glory of God. <p style="color: #1c265f;">(Gen. 1-2; 5; 11; Exod. 20:8-11; Ps. 19:1-6; 33:6, 9; 104; Isa. 45:12, 18; Acts 17:24;

                  <span><strong>The Nature of Humanity</strong></span>
                  <p>Man and woman were made in the image of God with individuality, the power and freedom to think and to do.
Though created free beings, each is an indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit, dependent upon God for life and
breath and all else. When our first parents disobeyed God, they denied their dependence upon Him and fell from
their high position. The image of God in them was marred and they became subject to death. Their descendants
share this fallen nature and its consequences. They are born with weaknesses and tendencies to evil. But God in
Christ reconciled the world to Himself and by His Spirit restores in penitent mortals the image of their Maker.
Created for the glory of God, they are called to love Him and one another, and to care for their environment.  <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7, 15; 3; Ps. 8:4-8; 51:5, 10; 58:3; Jer. 17:9; Acts 17:24-28; Rom. 5:12-17; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Eph. 2:3; 1

                  <span><strong>The Great Controversy</strong></span>
                  <p>All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His
law, and His sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven when a created being, endowed with
freedom of choice, in self-exaltation became Satan, God’s adversary, and led into rebellion a portion of the angels.
He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted in
the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of the created world, and its eventual devastation
at the time of the global flood, as presented in the historical account of Genesis 1-11. Observed by the whole creation, this world became the arena of the universal conflict, out of which the God of love will ultimately be vindicated. To assist His people in this controversy, Christ sends the Holy Spirit and the loyal angels to guide, protect, and

                  <p>In Christ’s life of perfect obedience to God’s will, His suffering, death, and resurrection, God provided the only
means of atonement for human sin, so that those who by faith accept this atonement may have eternal life, and
the whole creation may better understand the infinite and holy love of the Creator. This perfect atonement vindicates the righteousness of God’s law and the graciousness of His character; for it both condemns our sin and
provides for our forgiveness. The death of Christ is substitutionary and expiatory, reconciling and transforming.
The bodily resurrection of Christ proclaims God’s triumph over the forces of evil, and for those who accept the
atonement assures their final victory over sin and death. It declares the Lordship of Jesus Christ, before whom every knee in heaven and on earth will bow. <p style="color: #1c265f;">  (Gen. 3:15; Ps. 22:1; Isa. 53; John 3:16; 14:30; Rom. 1:4; 3:25; 4:25; 8:3, 4; 1

                  <p>In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the
righteousness of God. Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Saviour and Lord, Substitute and Example. This saving faith comes through
the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God’s grace. Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God’s sons
and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God’s law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in
Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 45:22; 53; Jer. 31:31-34; Ezek. 33:11; 36:25-27; Hab. 2:4; Mark 9:23, 24; John 3:3-8, 16; 16:8; Rom.

                  <p>By His death on the cross Jesus triumphed over the forces of evil. He who subjugated the demonic spirits during His
earthly ministry has broken their power and made certain their ultimate doom. Jesus’ victory gives us victory over
the evil forces that still seek to control us, as we walk with Him in peace, joy, and assurance of His love. Now the Holy
Spirit dwells within us and empowers us. Continually committed to Jesus as our Saviour and Lord, we are set free
from the burden of our past deeds. No longer do we live in the darkness, fear of evil powers, ignorance, and meaninglessness of our former way of life. In this new freedom in Jesus, we are called to grow into the likeness of His
character, communing with Him daily in prayer, feeding on His Word, meditating on it and on His providence, singing His praises, gathering together for worship, and participating in the mission of the Church. We are also called
to follow Christ’s example by compassionately ministering to the physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual
needs of humanity. As we give ourselves in loving service to those around us and in witnessing to His salvation, His
constant presence with us through the Spirit transforms every moment and every task into a spiritual experience. <p style="color: #1c265f;">(1 Chron. 29:11; Ps. 1:1, 2; 23:4; 77:11, 12; Matt. 20:25-28; 25:31-46; Luke 10:17-20; John 20:21; Rom. 8:38, 39; 2 Cor.

                  <p>The church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. In continuity with the
people of God in Old Testament times, we are called out from the world; and we join together for worship, for fellowship, for instruction in the Word, for the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, for service to humanity, and for the
worldwide proclamation of the gospel. The church derives its authority from Christ, who is the incarnate Word revealed in the Scriptures. The church is God’s family; adopted by Him as children, its members live on the basis of
the new covenant. The church is the body of Christ, a community of faith of which Christ Himself is the Head. The
church is the bride for whom Christ died that He might sanctify and cleanse her. At His return in triumph, He will
present her to Himself a glorious church, the faithful of all the ages, the purchase of His blood, not having spot
or wrinkle, but holy and without blemish. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> . (Gen. 12:1-3; Exod. 19:3-7; Matt. 16:13-20; 18:18; 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38-42;

                  <p>The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread
apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. This remnant
announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His
second advent. This proclamation is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14; it coincides with the work
of judgment in heaven and results in a work of repentance and reform on earth. Every believer is called to have a
personal part in this worldwide witness.<p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Dan. 7:9-14; Isa. 1:9; 11:11; Jer. 23:3; Mic. 2:12; 2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Peter 1:16-19;

                  <p>The church is one body with many members, called from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we
are a new creation; distinctions of race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between high and low,
rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has
bonded us into one fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served without partiality or
reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach
out in one witness to all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who has adopted us as His
children. <p style="color: #1c265f;">. (Ps. 133:1; Matt. 28:19, 20; John 17:20-23; Acts 17:26, 27; Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17; Gal.

                  <span><strong>Baptism</strong></span>
                  <p>By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of
our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and
are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins,
and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus
and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings.  <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.)</p></p>

                  <p>The Lord’s Supper is a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him,
our Lord and Saviour. In this experience of communion Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As we
partake, we joyfully proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes again. Preparation for the Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and confession. The Master ordained the service of foot-washing to signify renewed cleansing,
to express a willingness to serve one another in Christlike humility, and to unite our hearts in love. The communion
service is open to all believing Christians. <p style="color: #1c265f;">. (Matt. 26:17-30; John 6:48-63; 13:1-17; 1 Cor. 10:16, 17; 11:23-30; Rev. 3:20.)</p></p>

                  <p>God bestows upon all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts that each member is to employ in loving
ministry for the common good of the church and of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and ministries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions. According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for
the help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of God and endowed by the Spirit for functions
recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelistic, and teaching ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up the church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowledge of God.
When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful stewards of God’s varied grace, the church is protected
from the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built up in faith and
love. <p style="color: #1c265f;">  (Acts 6:1-7; Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 27, 28; Eph. 4:8, 11-16; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1 Peter 4:10, 11.)</p></p>

                  <p>The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with prophetic
authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church. They also make clear that the
Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested.  <p style="color: #1c265f;"> . (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel

                  <p>The great principles of God’s law are embodied in the Ten Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They express God’s love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age. These precepts are the basis of God’s covenant with His people and the standard in God’s judgment. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Saviour. Salvation is all of grace and not of works, and its fruit is obedience to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian character and results in a sense of well-being. It is evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellow human beings. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Exod. 20:1-17; Deut. 28:1-14; Ps. 19:7-14; 40:7, 8; Matt. 5:17-20; 22:36-40; John 14:15; 15:7-10; Rom. 8:3, 4; Eph. 2:8-10; Heb. 8:8-10; 1 John 2:3; 5:3; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.)</p></p>

                  <p>The gracious Creator, after the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath for all
people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God’s unchangeable law requires the observance
of this seventh-day Sabbath as the day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice
of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful communion with God and one another. It is a
symbol of our redemption in Christ, a sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our
eternal future in God’s kingdom. The Sabbath is God’s perpetual sign of His eternal covenant between Him and
His people. Joyful observance of this holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of God’s
creative and redemptive acts. <p style="color: #1c265f;"> . (Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 20:8-11; 31:13-17; Lev. 23:32; Deut. 5:12-15; Isa. 56:5, 6; 58:13, 14;

of the earth and its resources. We are responsible to Him for their proper use. We acknowledge God’s ownership
by faithful service to Him and our fellow human beings, and by returning tithe and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stewardship is a privilege given to us by God for
nurture in love and the victory over selfishness and covetousness. Stewards rejoice in the blessings that come to
others as a result of their faithfulness. <p style="color: #1c265f;">(Gen. 1:26-28; 2:15; 1 Chron. 29:14; Haggai 1:3-11; Mal. 3:8-12; Matt. 23:23;

                  <p>We are called to be a godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony with biblical principles in all aspects of
personal and social life. For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve ourselves only in those
things that will produce Christlike purity, health, and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While recognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat, befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward
adornment but in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that because our bodies
are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we
are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures. Since
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to
abstain from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our wholesomeness, joy, and goodness. <p style="color: #1c265f;">(Gen. 7:2; Exod. 20:15; Lev. 11:1-47; Ps. 106:3;

                  <p>Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a
woman in loving companionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and
should be entered into only between a man and a woman who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect,
and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who
divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, a man and a woman who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ through
marriage may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses
the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message. Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the
Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving, tender, and caring guide who
wants them to become members of His body, the family of God which embraces both single and married persons.  <p style="color: #1c265f;"> (Gen. 2:18-25; Exod. 20:12; Deut. 6:5-9; Prov. 22:6; Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 5:31, 32; 19:3-9, 12; Mark 10:11, 12; John 2:1-11;

                  <p>There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up and not humans. In it Christ ministers on
our behalf, making available to believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the cross. At His
ascension, He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and, began His intercessory ministry, which was typified
by the work of the high priest in the holy place of the earthly sanctuary. In 1844, at the end of the prophetic period
of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His atoning ministry, which was typified by the work of the
high priest in the most holy place of the earthly sanctuary. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of the
ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In
that typical service the sanctuary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of Jesus. The investigative judgment reveals to heavenly intelligences who
among the dead are asleep in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first resurrection.
It also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith
of Jesus, and in Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This judgment vindicates
the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus. It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall
receive the kingdom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human probation before the
Second Advent. <p style="color: #1c265f;">. (Lev. 16; Num. 14:34; Ezek. 4:6; Dan. 7:9-27; 8:13, 14; 9:24-27; Heb. 1:3; 2:16, 17; 4:14-16; 8:1-5; 9:11-

25:8; John 5:28, 29; 11:11-14; Rom. 6:23; 16; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; Col. 3:4; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 20:1-10.)</p></p>

                  <span><strong>The Millennium and the End of Sin</strong></span>
                  <p>The millennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in heaven between the first and second resurrections. During this time the wicked dead will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living human
inhabitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ with His saints and the Holy City will descend
from heaven to earth. The unrighteous dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround
the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever. <p style="color: #1c265f;">. (Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:18, 19; Mal. 4:1; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Rev. 20; 21:1-5.)</p></p>

                <li>
                  <span><strong>The New Earth </strong></span>
                  <p>On the new earth, in which righteousness dwells, God will provide an eternal home for the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, love, joy, and learning in His presence. For here God Himself will dwell with
His people, and suffering and death will have passed away. The great controversy will be ended, and sin will be no
more. All things, animate and inanimate, will declare that God is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen. <p style="color: #1c265f;">. (Isa. 35;
65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 11:15; 21:1-7; 22:1-5.)</p></p>

                        The Seventh-day Adventist Church traces its upcoming to
                        the early 19th century, emerging from the Millerite
                        movement of the 1830s-40s. God's sanctification of the
                        Sabbath and a revivalist atmosphere during the Second
                        Great Awakening laid foundational beliefs. Officially
                        established in 1863, it grew from New England roots into
                        a global faith community.

                        James Springer White, Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews
                        played pivotal roles in shaping early Seventh-day
                        Adventist doctrine and organization. Their teachings
                        emphasized biblical prophecy, health reform, and the
                        observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. By the late 19th
                        century, the church expanded beyond America,
                        establishing a presence worldwide

                        Throughout the 20th century, the Seventh-day Adventist
                        Church gained recognition as a distinct Christian
                        denomination through theological dialogues and academic
                        reviews initiated by evangelical leaders. This era also
                        saw significant global expansion, with missions reaching
                        continents beyond North America, solidifying its status
                        as a prominent international religious organization.
